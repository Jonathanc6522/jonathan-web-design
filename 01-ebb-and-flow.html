      <h2>Lyrics:</h2>
      <p1>
      <i><ul>The ebb and flow</ul>  
         <ul>The smaller things</ul>  
         <ul>The flight of the crow</ul>  
         <ul>Is life and death still all that we know</ul>
      </i>
      The ebb and flow of the waves. There is more to our existance than the instinct to survive, yet it's still something we concern ourselves with more than anything else, isn't it?
      <i>
        <ul>We all come and we all fade away</ul>
        <ul>Nightmares and dreams</ul>
        <ul>The call of the fray</ul>
        <ul>This night will soon be turned to day.</ul>
      </i>
      There is a monotony in this world. Time waits for no man. With every angel comes a demon, every birth a death, there's no story that goes without reciprocal
